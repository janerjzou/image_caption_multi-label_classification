The aim of this study is to apply deep learning algorithms that could achieve high performance to classify images based on image information and caption into multiple labels. (The size of the model required less than 100MB.)


Applied fusion techniques to combine a pre-trained image-based classification model EfficientNet-B4 with a text-based classification model Bi-LSTM to make the classifier gain information from both image and caption contents.

Achieved a mean F1-score of approximately 90 within a reasonable amount of time and the final model size is 80.1 Mb. This project obtained a High Distinction mark.(98/100)
